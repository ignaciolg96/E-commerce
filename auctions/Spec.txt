1. CREATE LISTING:

    > Create a new listing, being able to specify a title, a description, and the starting bid. OPTIONALLY,
      a URL for an image and/or category can be provided. 

    FIX ME:
        * As of now, URL and category are mandatory :( ---> SOLVED, though the category, if no other, should be misc
        * A user should be able to create the category if it doesn't exist just by typing it. 
          ---> NOT GOOD DESIGN, you could end up with millions of potentially useless categories.



2. ACTIVE LISTINGS PAGE:

    > Default route. View of all currently active listings.
    > For each active listing, the page should at least display: title, description, current price, photo.

    TO DO:
        * Improve page design. 




3. LISTING PAGE:

    > Details about listing: CURRENT PRICE
    > If signed in: - " Add to/Remove from watchlist"
                    - " Bid ". Bid must be larger than current max bid. 
                    - " Close auction". This determines winner, and the listing should be no longer active. 
                    - If auction is closed, the page should say so. 
                    - " Comment ". All comments should be displayed. 

    FIX ME:
        * Almost every aspect :'D
        * Watchlist and bid not working properly ---> SOLVED(1)
        * Close auction and closed auction page not implemented. (3)
        * Unsigned user CANT see listings. ---> SOLVED(2)
        
    --->* Comments get re-submited on refresh!<--- 

        (1)
        * Bid working just fine! Problem was, I updated a foreign key's name without ever migrating the changes. 
        * Add/remove watchlist also working! ALTHOUGH NOT SHOWING IN WATCHLIST PAGE
        (2)
        * Listing page for unlogged users ACTIVE. I retrieved log_required tag from listing and listing info,
          arranged them so that a logged user has access to every feature, and conditionated the html
        (3)
        * Closed auction is taken off the active listings. If user requesting the page is the winner, the page
          says so. Otherwise, it says bidding closed. 




4. WATCHLIST: 

    > Display all watched listings. Clicking should take to listing page.

    TO DO:
        * Implement ---> SOLVED

    FIX ME:
    * Bug with the add to watchlist button... Kinda like a false press at first, then works fine...




5. CATEGORIES: 

    > All listing categories. Clicking should take to a page that displays all of the active listings
    
    TO DO:
        * Implement ---> SOLVED
